# Slurm Bridge Operator

Slurm bridge operator is a Kubernetes operator implementation, capable of submitting and monitoring slurm jobs, It acts
as a proxy for the external slurm cluster in the k8s cluster

## Description

The slurm bridge operator consists of the following five components:

- [SlurmAgent](cmd/slurm-agent/slurm-agent.go)
- [Configurator](cmd/configurator/configurator.go)
- [SlurmVirtualKubelet](cmd/slurm-virtual-kubelet/slurm-virtual-kubelet.go)
- [BridgeOperator](cmd/bridge-operator/bridge-operator.go)
- [ResultFetcher](cmd/result-fetcher/result-fetcher.go)

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster and a Slurm cluster to run against.

### Running on the cluster

1. Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriskery/slurm-bridge-operator
cd slurm-bridge-operator
```

2. Install Slurm Bridge Operator CRDs.

```sh
maek install
###Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`.
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/slurm-agent-bridge-operator:tag
###Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`.
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/slurm-agent-bridge-operator:tag
```

3. Build and install slurm agent on the slurm login node as a proxy between kubernetes and slurm cluster.
   The slurm-agent binary file will be build to bin/slurm-agent

```shell
make build

```

4. Install configurator.

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/configurator.yaml
```
